we had a birthday party here recently and the $T$ and service was amazing , but the qualities were good enough to make up for it , the portions are now very small and the special , grilled branding , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .

not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other $T$ allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck , but the heavy vault like door , a wonderful start to the meal and i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system .

highly recommended ... as stated , i have n't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing $T$ ; also , the bar looks nice ; the entree was bland and small , yeah , sometimes the service can be slow . and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimum then you 'll love it here .
