my laptop now has no $T$ , but its long battery life , small enough to use on a long flight , light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips . and how toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an initial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .

i was ready to take it back for a refund , but the $T$ camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed ; the sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of headphones . and also consider the ms office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .

it is very easy to $T$ on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted , but the dvd drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying . the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade . and a bad connector .

i love the easy to see $T$ , and it works well for work , persoal or just play , but ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers , the only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set . and after much effort and 10 days asus replaced tithe wi-fi is very weak .

i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great $T$ , but support has been lackluster , the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the ibook , and it needs to upgrade patches to make less easy for people to hack into .
