half a chicken with a mountain of $T$ and beans for $ 6.25 , but the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system and if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't .

the other times i 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a vip in a not-crowded place , with great food and $T$ , but complimentary noodles , the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size . and overall , not worth the money .

try the $T$ and the pizza with soy cheese , but dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served and that order was under cooked , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill , the only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4 , which makes no sense whatsoever . and compared to san it is slow in service and overpriced .
