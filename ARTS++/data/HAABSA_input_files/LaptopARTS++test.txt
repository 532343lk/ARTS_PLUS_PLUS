i like the mini mac it was easy to setup and install , but i am learning as i go and could use a $T$ to learn how to use some of the features i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu ; you are familiar with microsoft windows and take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .
