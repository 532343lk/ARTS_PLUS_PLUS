the $T$ then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else ; menus feature seasonal picks , like sweet corn-phone gas brul� . in the past the service was average and the portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
